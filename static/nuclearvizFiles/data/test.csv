( Gamma Surveys) , was conducting density level measurements using sealed sources under reciprocity at the Conoco Phillips Corporation refinery in Carson, CA," the evening of 12/21/04.  Special form sealed sources containing radioactive material are employed for ""gamma scanning"," diagnostic evaluation, typically density or level measurements, of industrial processes or equipment.  At about 1900 one such source, 287 mCi, Co-60, contained in a collimating device at the end of a stainless-steel, stranded cable, was being lowered down the outside of a large, cylindrical distillation vessel"," "" designated FR-1 Flasher Column", 200 ft. high and 28 ft. in diameter.  Stiffening rings which protrude about 18 inches externally encircle the vessel at various heights.  As the source is being lowered down the side of the vessel," the operator located at the top of the vessel must manually ""shake"" the cable to get the source over the protruding stiffening rings.  On this occasion", the collimating device with the Co-60 source broke at the cable during this shaking to get it over a stiffening ring 20 feet from the top.  The source came to rest on the stiffening ring," in the "" unshielded"" condition", where it remained overnight.  However, Gamma Surveys indicated that the area was cleared of personnel and cordoned off.  Radiation surveys were taken at the ground level showing no appreciable dose rates," approximately 0.04 mR/hr.  ""The next day", 12/22/04, Gamma Surveys proposed a recovery plan to lower an operator in a man-basket down to the source to manually put the source back in its shielded condition ( normal practice) and then attach a replacement cable to the collimating device so that it may be reeled back into its shielded container at the top of the vessel for subsequent evaluation and repair of the damaged system.  After consultation with RHB staff and the RSO for Gamma Surveys, this plan was effected.  By about 5 PM, 12/22/04," the source recovery was completed without problems.

The State received this letter December 14,2004, & LA County received the letter December 21, 2004.  Pomona reported that on October 14, 2004 while packaging excess  I-125 seeds for return to the manufacturer, the dosimetrist discovered a shortage of seven seeds from a prostate implant done on Sept 30, 2004.  They resurveyed the operating room & waste containers, but could not find the sources.  They think the seeds were accidentally washed down the drain when the top part of the Mick Applicator cartridge was washed. They are obtaining additional information, such as the activity of the seeds.  However, these seeds are normally about 0.3-0.4 mCi each, so seven seeds would be more than the one mCi I-125 that requires immediate reporting.They are reporting this as a loss that required immediate notification, but based on the information currently available, it appears unlikely that the loss could have resulted in exposure to persons in unrestricted areas.CA 5010 Number:  122204,https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/event-status/event/2004/20041228en.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The technologist had no credible explanation for this, and has resigned to pursue a different career unrelated to radiation safety or radioactive material.In this circumstance, it is highly unlikely that any measurable dose was received by anyone, since the lab staff handles each radioactive vial with great care, and stores it safely after pickup from the RSO lab or delivery by the RSO staff.  Also, not one package received from 1/1/01 on, was contaminated above DOT's safety limit, or even 2% of that limit.  Any box that is contaminated is kept in radwaste.To prevent any recurrence of such undocumented records, the licensee has increased the direct supervision of the package opening procedure by the Radiation Safety Officer, who will also sign or initial the scintillation counter printout sheets of the wipe test results henceforward.The licensee believes that the technologist's resignation, and the RSO review of the wipe test printout sheets, will prevent any inaccurate or undocumented entries in these important NRC records in the future.,https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/event-status/event/2004/20041214en.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These five valves are to be tagged closed during the time when refueling containment closure is required.-   On 12/12/04 at approx 2100 a question as to if refueling containment closure was established on the steam generators was raised.

""Initial Safety Significance: ""This event is being reported as a condition which could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures that are needed to control the release of radioactive material.  The requirements on containment penetration closure ensure that a release of fission product radioactivity within containment will be restricted from escaping to the environment.""Section 15.11.2.2 of the Oconee UFSAR addresses a Fuel Handling Accident inside Containment.  The 1977 analysis concludes that the worst case release is appropriately within 10 CFR 100 limits but does not take any credit for containment.  For this event the potential flow rate would be restricted due to the size of the open valves", the diameter of the piping from one open 3/4 inch valve in the Containment building to the four open 2 inch valves and one 3 inch valve in the Turbine Building," and the absence of a significant differential pressure.""Oconee wishes to note that a TS amendment incorporating Alternate Source Terms has been approved", but is currently awaiting implementation," which would only require refueling containment closure during movement of recently irradiated fuel (i.e. fuel moved within 72 hours of criticality).  This event began on day 59 of the current refueling outage.  Thus the potential for a significant release of radioactive material as a result of a postulated fuel handling accident during this time period was greatly reduced.""Corrective Actions:""At the time of discovery fuel handling operations were no longer in effect.

Hope Creek Generating Station is currently offline in a refueling outage.  PSEG Nuclear currently plans to begin reducing power on both Salem Units on Friday December 3, 2004.  PSEG Nuclear is continually monitoring river conditions and tracking the progress of the oil spill.  Today, PSEG Nuclear began placing booms around the water intake structures at both Salem and Hope Creek nuclear generating stations.  The boom is a barrier placed approximately 18 inches deep in the water and is relatively effective in controlling the spread of oil that is on top or close to the surface.  However, since the oil spilled in the Delaware River was crude oil, it is expected that the heavier oil might be suspended in the river at varying depths, increasing the potential that oil could reach the plant intake structures.  Since the potential exists to adversely impact the plant cooling systems if oil was entrained in the plant cooling water," both Salem 1 and 2 are going to be shutdown.""This report is being made due to the press release and the possibility that this release will generate public interest.  No power reduction has been started at this time.  At this time there has been no adverse impact noted on either Salem Unit 1 or 2 due to the oil spill.

The Camera is owned and licensed to H&H X-Ray Services that has an office located in East Point, Kentucky.  The camera was located in the radiographer's truck which was in the town of Corbin, Kentucky in preparation for a job.  The radiographer lent the truck to the assistant radiographer on Wednesday night (11/17/04).  The assistant radiographer did not return with the truck all day Thursday.  Without any contact with the assistant radiographer since Wednesday night, the radiographer reported the truck and camera stolen this morning (11/19/04).  The local police believe they saw the truck parked at a home in the Corbin area.  The camera was locked in the truck but the assistant radiographer has a key to the camera so the current status is unknown.The State has notified NRC Region 1 (Sheri Minnick).  In addition to the other Federal agencies notified above, contacted the National Response Center (Ms. Jones).* * * UPDATE 1420 EST ON 11/21/04 FROM CLYDE SLAUGHTER (RSO - H&H X-RAY SERVICES, INC.)

83,41220,Other Nuclear Material,NON EMERGENCY,11/23/2004,15:56 [ET],11/23/2004,[EST],NJ,REPORT OF THEFT OR LOSS OF LICENSED MATERIALThe following information is excerpted from an email submitted by the licensee describing in detail the circumstances and conclusions concerning the missing rad material:..II. DESCRIPTION OF LOSS OF LICENSED MATERIALRadioisotope: Phosphorous-32Chemical Form:  Deoxycytidine 5'-Triphosphate [alpha-32P]Physical Form: Aqueous Solution Amount:  Xenogen appears to be missing material from 2 separate vials as outlined below:1.   150 µCi (15 µl of material at 10 µCi/µl) from a vial sent from GE HealthCare (formerly Amersham Biosciences) to Xenogen Biosciences on November 4, 2004.  This vial was received at Xenogen Biosciences on Friday, November 5, 2004.  The supplier's catalog number for the material is AA0005-1 mCi and the lot number for the material received is AC0445.  The quantity requested was 1000 µCi (37 MBq) under Purchase Order No. 36348.  This vial was designated internally within Xenogen Biosciences as vial No. 491.2.   100 µCi (10 µl of material at 10 µCi/µl) from a vial sent from GE HealthCare (formerly Amersham Biosciences) to Xenogen Biosciences on November 11, 2004.  This vial was received at Xenogen Biosciences on Friday, November 12, 2004.  The supplier's catalog number for the material is AA0005-1 mCi and the lot number for the material received is AC0446.  The quantity requested was 1000 µCi (37 MBq) under Purchase Order No. 36348.  This vial was designated internally within Xenogen Biosciences as vial No. 492.Activity:  3000 Ci (111TBq)/mmole..V.  PROBABLE DISPOSITION OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL INVOLVEDAs of November 23,2004, our current hypothesis is that the volume discrepancies (loss) of material in vials 491 and 492 were due to two conditions.  First, the material appears to be evaporating in the vials.  Second, any evaporated moisture that condensed on the lid of the vial is not being concentrated through centrifugation prior to removal of material by research associates.  Evidence that supports this conclusion is listed below:1.  We have found that when this material is separated into 5 µl aliquots, placed in screw cap tubes with o-rings, and stored at 4°C for several days, the liquid evaporates and a dried and visible red pellet forms (concentrated dye).  In addition, the volume of the pellet appears to be less than 1 µl (visual inspection).  However, when the tube is centrifuged after storage, the full volume reappears in the bottom of the tube and can be confirmed by using a pipetting device.  The experiment mentioned above was performed using one vial of 1000 µCi of Redivue[TM] [alpha-32] deoxycytidine 5'-Triphosphate (dCTP) from GE Healthcare that was received at Xenogen Biosciences on Friday, November 19, 2004.  This vial was designated internally as vial 493.  Volume discrepancies were first noticed on Monday, November 22, 2004. 2.  The occurrence of volume discrepancies in vial 491 and 492, along with a similar incident involving vial 486, which was reported to the U.S NRC on October 13,2004, coincides with the recent switch (July 2004) by Xenogen from [alpha -32P] dCTP supplied by PE Life Sciences to material supplied by GE Healthcare.  Unlike the material supplied by PE Life Sciences, the material from GE Healthcare is not kept frozen during transit and storage, but rather at 4 degrees Celsius.   Hence, the material is subject to evaporation and condensation at the top of the vial.3.  Upon arrival, we have found that these vials need to be centrifuged in order to collect the material at the bottom of the vial.  If the vials are not centrifuged, we are unable to verify that the volume sent is correct.   Because it was determined that the volume of both vials was correct prior to any removal of material, we have eliminated the possibility that an incorrect volume was shipped to our facility by GE Healthcare.4.   During the November 18 meeting with the researchers, one employee notified [the RSO] with the EHS department, that he failed to make a log entry for which he removed 50 µCi from vial 492.  Other than this particular instance, there is no further evidence that a research associate or scientist removed material from vial 491 and 492 and failed to record this removal in the Isotope Inventory Log.  Importantly, this discrepancy has been accounted for in the total amount of material missing from vial 492 as detailed in this report.5.  There appears to be no evidence that the volume discrepancies are due to inaccurate pipetting devices.  Last month, all three P-20 pipetman that are used by users to remove radioactive material from P-32 vials were checked for accuracy by [the RSO].  Importantly, this evidence does not rule out the possibility a user had the pipettor accidentally set to a higher volume prior to removal or that the user did not use the pipetting device correctly.6.  There is no evidence that an employee or visitor intentionally stole licensed material from vial 491 and 492.  Because of the number of employees (approximately 65) at the facility, employees, in general, know one another and work in an environment where they are likely to observe any unusual behavior.  In addition, there are relatively few visitors come to the facility.  Furthermore, the refrigerator that is used to store the vials of P-32 material is locked with a combination lock.  Only users of radioactive material have access to this combination.  Moreover, the room (Radioisotope Laboratory) is locked by a punch combination lock.  Only users of radioactive material have access to this combination.  All employees, whether they are a user or nonuser of radioactive material, receive training that explicitly informs them that it is a crime to remove radioactive material from the facility.  7.  There is no evidence that a research associate or scientist recorded an inaccurate amount of material withdrawn from vial 491 or 492 because all employees who used vial 491 and 492 verified, through interviews conducted by [the RSO], that the amount of material indicated on the Isotope Inventory Log is the amount that was intended to be used.  8.  There is no evidence that the loss was due to spillage because:a.  There were no reports of a spillage by anyone who worked with the material;b.  The amount of material presumed missing would have easily been detected through our weekly monitoring program by swipe analysis using a Liquid Scintillation Counter.  Furthermore, 100 µCi would have easily been detected from monitoring conducted with a GM survey meter by other employees who used the Radioisotope Laboratory over the time in question.VI.  EXPOSURE OF INDIVIDUALS TO RADIATIONFollowing an intensive survey of the laboratory area and other sections of the building, there is no indication of radiation exposure to individuals due to the unaccounted material.VII.  ACTIONS TAKEN TO RECOVER MATERIALAt this time, our current hypothesis is that the volume discrepancies with vials 491 and 492 are due to two conditions: 1) evaporation of material within the vial and 2) lack of centrifugation of vials prior to removal of material.  Hence, it is not anticipated that the material will be found.  More importantly, if it is true that the lost volume was due to evaporation, then radioactivity may not be actually missing.  Again, the Radiation Safety Officer does not believe that any employee, or non-employee," unlawfully removed licensed material from vial 491 and 492. . . . . VIII. PROCEDURES OR MEASURES THAT WILL BE ADOPTED TO ENSURE AGAINST A RECURRENCE OF THE LOSS OR THEFT OF LICENSED MATERIAL.The company has implemented the following Standard Operating Procedures immediately to insure that 1) the material is not being removed by a user without correct documentation; 2) the material is not being taken or removed for purposes other than those purposes outlined in Materials License 29-30350-01; and 3) the proper amount of material is being used in each experiment.1.  Every commercial vial of P-32 entering the facility and which will be used for DNA/RNA labeling experiments will be separated into 5 µl aliquots (or the volume typically used for one reaction) at the time the package is surveyed and its contents verified.  The aliquots will be consecutively numbered for tracking purposes.  Aliquots will be stored in Eppendorf tubes and these tubes will be stored in shielded centrifuge test tube racks.  The rack will be made of acrylic and will be a solid-block design with drilled wells.  One rack will hold aliquots from only one source vial (e.g. Shielded rack reads ""vial no. 500"" . Eppendorf tubes within read 1-20).2.  A user should use the lowest consecutive numbered aliquot when removing an aliquot from the rack for use. 3.  [The RSO] (or his designee) will check daily the supply of P-32 aliquots and determine if there are any inconsistencies with the number of aliquots versus the number used by researchers based on the Isotope Inventory Log (or equivalent).In addition", all pipetting devices used during the handling or dispensing of P-32 will be calibrated immediately by a commercial vendor, unless recently calibrated in the last 2 months.  As mentioned earlier, [the RSO and another individual] met with all users of P-32 at the Cranbury Facility on November 18, 2004 to make them aware of the problem, to review pipetting techniques, and to train them on the new SOPs.HOO Note:  See similar Event Report #41126.,https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/event-status/event/2004/20041124en.html
